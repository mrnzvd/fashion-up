# Fashion Up

Fashion Up is a real brand developed by my friend, the designer Taísa Souza. My purpose with this project is to create an institutional website for her where she can introduce her brand and also have a space for customers to book alterations.

# UX
### Site Purpose
The purpose of this site is to introduce Fashion Up as a brand sharing information about the brand itself and the designer.

# Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was created on [coolors](https://coolors.co/) by Taísa, the designer, and shared with me. The reasoning behing the colour scheme is to have clean neutral colours with pops os pink, her favourite colour.

### Typography
The typography was chosen by Taísa, the designer, and downloaded from [CDN fonts](https://www.cdnfonts.com/category/handwritten). The aim is to have the contrast from a handwritten font for titles to a more mechanical font for paragraphs.

### Imagery
The banner image was created by me on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The other images were produced by Taísa, the designer, who shared with me with the purpose to add it on the website.

# Features
### Languages  used

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar contains all five sections. This is a single page website and each item directs to its section. 

![navigation bar](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/navigation.png)

### Landing Page
![landing page](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/landingpage.png)

The landing page, displayed above, shows the store's main statement, the navigation bar and the banner image not appearing on its entirety. The reason why the banner image is not appearing fully is to entice visitors to see the rest of the page's information, which they can do by scrolling down or clicking on the menu.

### The Brand
![the brand](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/thebrandsection.png)
This section is directly below the landing page, and shares information about the brand and their mission. 

### The Designer
![the designer](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/thedesignersection.png)
As in fashion the designer is the face of the brand, this section's aim is to introduce the designer's point of view about fashion and a bit of their history.

### Alterations 
![alterations](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/alterationssection.png)
The main service offered at this moment is clothing alterations, so this section is there to facilitate booking using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/). 

### Projects
![projects](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/projectsection.png)

The brand's main focus is to be as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible and in this section updates about projects targetting this theme will be shown.

### Contact and Thank you page
![contact](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/contactsection.png)
A contact form was added at the end of the page so users can send their messages. After submission, the user will be redirected to a thank you page as seen below.

### Footer
![footer](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/footer.png)

Social media links were added to the footer.

### Scroll to top button
![scroll](https://beyondthesight.net/Mariana/Fashion/Images/read/scrollbutton.png)

As this is a one page website a scroll to top button, using Javascript, was added to make the navigation easier.

### Future Features:
- Videos showing clothing creation process.
- Videos and updates from projects that took place.
- When the brand is ready to launch and they start selling clothes, an ecommerce feature will be added.
